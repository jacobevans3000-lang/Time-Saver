Privacy Policy for Tab Auto Refresh (Seconds)

This extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal or sensitive user data. 
All settings (such as refresh interval, bypass cache, and per-URL profiles) are stored locally 
using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API and never leave your device.

We do not sell, transfer, or use user data for any purpose other than the extension's 
single functionality: automatically refreshing browser tabs at user-defined intervals.

If you have questions, you may contact the developer at: Jacob.Evans3000@gmail.com
